            <p> As the city of ballads and wines, Mondstadtâ€™s alcohol industry is renowned all over Teyvat. As the owner
                of the Dawn Winery, Diluc is essentially in charge of the industry. This means he has a huge stream of
                revenue and an entire network of information in the form of tavern patrons' gossip right at his
                fingertips. In a way, he is the uncrowned king of Mondstadt.</p>
            <h3> <a name="Personality" >Personality </a> </h3>
            <hr class="content-separator">
            <p>Kaeya calls himself and Diluc "anti-heroes with attitude problems." Diluc was once a confident and
                passionate young man, dedicated to his work with the Knights of Favonius. But after his father's
                untimely death, Diluc grew aloof, bitter, and distant. He dislikes wasting time on idle talk and grows
                impatient easily.</p>
            <p>Diluc holds a particular resentment towards the Knights of Favonius, whom he calls "inefficient" and
                snubs at every opportunity. This bitterness stems from Inspector Eroch's handling of his father's death,
                and Diluc has not lessened his bitterness even after Eroch was discharged from the Knights as a traitor.

            <p>Diluc has porcelain skin with a slim, athletic build, crimson red eyes, and scarlet-hued hair which is
                always worn in a messy ponytail that extends to his middle back. He dons a black coat that is adorned
                with golden trimmings and tassels, ending with ebony fur-trims, and wears black pants which are
                embellished with chains on his right thigh, while his Vision is settled upon his left thigh. Diluc also
                wears gloves, which are black on the top while the undersides are dyed a shade of red.
