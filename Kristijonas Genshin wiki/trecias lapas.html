            <hr class="content-separator">
            <p>  A bard that seems to have arrived on some unknown wind - sometimes sings songs as old as the hills, and other times sings poems fresh and new.
                Likes apples and lively places, but is not a fan of cheese or anything sticky. When using his Anemo power to control the wind,
                 it often appears as feathers, as he's fond of that which appears light and breezy.
            </p>
            <h3> <a name="Personality" > Personality </a> </h3>
            <hr class="content-separator">
            <p> Venti has a rather mischievous attitude and a liking to rhyming in his speech, but if told to stop he will stop immediately. He sees a certain worth in music to the point where he names his lyre, 
                saying "every being deserves a name to be called upon, and woven into a song". He is also quite bold, shown many times in both the manga and the game, not fearing to insult or ignore those who are supposedly powerful.
            </p>
            <p>Despite his naive personality as Venti, the Wind Archon himself might as well be a different side to him, in which Venti attests to saying 
                "That's that for the Anemo Archon's admonishments! Back to Venti time!". When Venti assumes his personality as the Wind Archon, he speaks wisely and rather philosophically, guiding the Traveler, like he guided Mondstadt in its beginnings.
            </p>
            <h3> <a name="Appearance" >Appearance </a> </h3>
            <hr class="content-separator">
            <p> Venti has fair skin, aqua eyes, and a slim build. He has dark blue hair that borders on black, with short twin braids that fade into an aqua color that shines in bright cyan when casting magic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He wears a frilly white top with a corset-like leather midsection, along with teal shorts with gold embroidery, a matching teal cape held together by a deep blue and gold bow, white stockings with 3 gold diamond shapes along each leg, 
                and a beret-like hat with a Cecilia, which is his favorite flower. He carries a wooden lyre with blue strings imbued with the power of Anemo.
